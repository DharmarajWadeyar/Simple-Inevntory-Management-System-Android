# Simple Inventory Management System

## Project Description
The Simple Inventory Management System is designed to digitize inventory management processes that were traditionally handled manually using hardcopies. This project aims to streamline inventory management by reducing time spent on manual entries and minimizing the risk of losing records. The system allows users to manage product details, calculate subtotals, and handle payments electronically.
